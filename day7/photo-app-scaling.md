# SnapShare - Scaling Plan

## Assumptions

- 10,000,000 registered users, 10% active daily = 1,000,000 DAU.
- Each active user uploads 1 photo and views 50 feed pages per day.
- Photo: 2 MB. Thumbnail: 50 KB. 1 day ≈ 100,000 seconds. Peak = 5x average.

## Estimates

- Uploads: 1,000,000/day ≈ 10 per second (peak ≈ 50/s).
- Feed views: 50,000,000/day ≈ 500 per second (peak ≈ 2,500/s).
- Storage: 1,000,000 × 2.05 MB ≈ 2 TB/day ≈ 750 TB/year.

## Read-heavy or write-heavy?

Very read-heavy: about 50 feed views for every upload. We should make
reads cheap (CDN for images, cache for feeds, read replicas) and keep
uploads reliable rather than instant.

## Where do the photos go?

Photos must NOT be stored in the database. 750 TB/year of large binary
files would make the database huge, slow and expensive to back up.

Photo files go into object storage (such as Amazon S3), which is built
for cheap, durable storage of large files. The database stores only
each photo's metadata: id, owner, caption, time and the file's URL.

## Components

- CDN: serves photos from servers near users, so images load fast
  and our servers are not overloaded by 2,500 feed views per second.
- Object storage: cheap, durable home for hundreds of terabytes of files.
- Load balancer: spreads API traffic and removes failed servers.
- App servers (stateless): handle API requests; add more as traffic grows.
- Cache: keeps each user's prepared feed in memory for fast scrolling.
- Primary database: the source of truth for users, follows and photo metadata.
- Read replicas: handle the heavy feed queries, protecting the primary.
- Queue + thumbnail worker: creates thumbnails in the background so
  the upload request can finish quickly.

## Upload flow

1. The app sends the photo to an app server through the load balancer.
2. The app server checks the user's token and the file type and size.
3. It saves the original file to object storage.
4. It inserts a row with the photo's metadata into the primary database.
5. It adds a job "make thumbnail for photo 123" to the queue.
6. It replies 201 Created to the user straight away.
7. A worker takes the job, creates the 50 KB thumbnail, saves it to
   object storage and updates the photo's row with the thumbnail URL.
8. The followers' cached feeds are invalidated so the photo appears.

## Trade-offs

1. Speed vs freshness: feeds come from the cache, so a new photo may
   take a few seconds to appear for followers. This is acceptable for
   a social app and greatly reduces database load.

2. Simplicity vs speed of upload: thumbnails are made in the background.
   For a moment the photo has no thumbnail, and the app shows a
   placeholder, but uploads stay fast even during busy periods.

3. Cost: CDN and object storage cost money per gigabyte, but they are
   far cheaper and more reliable than storing and serving hundreds of
   terabytes from our own servers.
